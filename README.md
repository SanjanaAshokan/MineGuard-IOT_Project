**MineGuard: Smart Helmet for Miners**
    MineGuard is an intelligent safety helmet system designed to protect miners by continuously monitoring their working environment and health status. 
    It integrates Arduino Mega 2560 as the central controller, with sensors like MQ2 and MQ7 for detecting harmful gases, DHT22 for temperature and humidity, and an ultrasonic sensor for obstacle detection. 
    A pulse sensor tracks the minerâ€™s heart rate, while Neo 6M GPS provides real-time location tracking. 
    The system uses ESP32 and GSM 800 for wireless communication and SMS alerts, ensuring immediate emergency notifications. 
    A DFPlayer Mini with a speaker offers audio warnings, and the Blynk app allows remote monitoring of all sensor data. 
    Powered by a 12V lithium battery with LM2596 module.
MineGuard enhances worker safety by offering real-time alerts, environmental awareness, and health monitoring in hazardous mining conditions.
